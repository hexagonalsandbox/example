Welcome, little architects, to "Hexagonal Sandbox," a special book where you'll discover the fun and fascinating world of hypermodularity with lots of colorful pictures to guide you.

What is hypermodularity, you ask? It's like using building blocks to create awesome structures that are super flexible and can change easily. 
Each block is a bit like a magic hexagon that comes together to make cool designs.

## Step One: 
Imagine you're playing with a giant toy that has special plugs and ports. These are part of our first step—the interface connection.
When you plug in a piece, you're sending a secret message from the start (INPUT) all the way to the finish (OUTPUT). It's like creating a path in a maze that will unleash a fun surprise!

## Step Two: 
Now, it's time for action! 
When you do something to an object, like pressing a button, you make it do something back—like light up or make a sound.
Each action brings your creation to life, turning your ideas into real, working things.

As you flip through the pages of "Hexagonal Sandbox," you'll see how these two steps come together to make incredible things.
With just your imagination and hypermodular magic, you'll build amazing projects that you can change any time you want.

Let's jump into the sandbox and start creating!
